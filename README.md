# SnapTrade CLI

`snaptrade` is the quickest way to get started with the [SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/) API. Link your own brokerage accounts, manage your portfolios, and execute live trades all from the command line!

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @snaptrade/snaptrade-cli
```

Then run the CLI:

```bash
snaptrade
```

When you run `snaptrade` for the first time, you need to provide your SnapTrade client ID and consumer key

Once the credentials are set, call `snaptrade connect` to connect a new account. This will register a new SnapTrade user and open the connection portal in your default browser.

Once connected, call `snaptrade connections` to list all connections

To submit an equity trade, use `snaptrade trade equity`. It'll prompt you for confirmation before continuing.

You can pass `--useLastAccount` to skip the account selector and use the previously selected account instead.
