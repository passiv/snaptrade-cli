# SnapTrade CLI

`snaptrade` is the quickest way to get started with the [SnapTrade](https://snaptrade.com/) API. Link your own brokerage accounts, manage your portfolios, and execute live trades all from the command line!

## üöÄ Quick Start

Install the CLI globally using npm:

```bash
npm install -g @snaptrade/snaptrade-cli
```

Then run the CLI:

```bash
snaptrade
```

When you run `snaptrade` for the first time, you need to provide your SnapTrade client ID and consumer key

---

Once the credentials are set, call `snaptrade connect` to connect a new account. This will register a new SnapTrade user and open the Connection Portal in your default browser. Pick a broker of your choice to finish the connection process. If you don't have/want to use a live account, you can register an Alpaca paper account with just an email and choose Alpaca Paper in the Connection Portal.

> [!NOTE]
> A free key only has access to a limited set of brokers and cannot execute live trades at the moment.

---

To see which brokers are supported along with whether trading is enabled, you can run `snaptrade brokers`.

> [!NOTE]
> To see the latest broker support and capabilities, please refer to this [Notion page](https://snaptrade.notion.site/brokerages).

You can also specify the broker directly with `snaptrade connect --broker <broker slug>` to skip the broker selection step of the Connection Portal.

Once connected, call `snaptrade connections` to list all current connections.

and `snaptrade accounts` to list all connected accounts.

Use `snaptrade positions` to list all positions for an account. You'll be prompted to select an account first.

or `snaptrade positions --all` to list all positions across all accounts.

---

To submit an equity order, use `snaptrade trade equity`. It'll prompt you for confirmation before continuing.

You can pass `--useLastAccount` to skip the account selector and use the previously selected account instead.

> [!NOTE]
> A free key does not have access to trading at the moment. Please reach out to sales@snaptrade.com to discuss your trading usecase.

To submit a multi-leg option order, use `snaptrade trade option`. It'll prompt you for confirmation before continuing.

---

Once the order is submitted successfully, you have the option to cancel it if it hasn't been filled by the broker. You can find the broker order ID in the response:

To submit a cancellation request, use `snaptrade cancel-order`. It'll prompt you for confirmation before continuing.

---

To see a list of all your recent orders, including the one you just placed, use `snaptrade orders`.
